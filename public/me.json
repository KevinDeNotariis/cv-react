  "description": "I am a very dynamic and curious guy, fascinated about the mysteries of our universe and the technology that we came to develop in these last few decades. My accademic path studying physics has been a wonderful journey, and I'm still amazed by the astonishing inner workings of our reality that we managed to discover mostly in the last couple of centuries. \n\nI love science and I love learning. I feel some kind of drive towards the unknown, I love to test my skills and face new challenges. \n\n```\n Always Improve\n```\n\n is my motto! \n\nRight now I'm into these topics:\n\n - Web Development;\n - DevOps;\n - Blockchain technologies;\n - Ethical Hacking. \n\nAlso, I started to publish articles on Medium hoping to transfer some of my knowledge to other people and ease their journey through all these technologies.",

I focused my time mainly on learning the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and creating a tutorial on my github on how to build a web site completely from scratch using these technologies (authentication / authorization - logging in, logging out - input sanification and validation). \nThe ethical hacking course gave me insights on network protocols, vulnerabilities of web applications, operating systems, etc.., how to exploit them and how to secure them.",
