  "description": "I am a very dynamic and curious guy, fascinated about the misteries of our universe and the technology that we came to develop in these last few decades. My accademic path studying physics has been a wonderful journey, and I'm still amazed by the astonishing inner workings of our reality that we managed to discover mostly in the last couple of centuries. \n\nI love science and I love learning. I feel some kind of drive towards the unknown, I love to test my skills and face new challenges. - Always improve - is my motto! \n\nRight now I'm into these topics:\n\n - Web Development;\n - DevOps;\n - Blockchain technologies;\n - Ethical Hacking. \n\nAlso, I started to publish articles on Medium hoping to transfer some of my knowledge to other people and ease their journey through all these technologies.",

      "description": "I have been assigned to a client in the Bank sector. Working for that client on mainframe technology by implementing Batch programs (in COBOL) and JCLs (DB2 as database). In particular I was focused on converting EASYTRIEVE programs to COBOL ones due to a change in a software provider by this client.\n\nIn the meantime (for most of the time, actually) I was learning and experimenting DevOps Tools and Techniques. In particular, I created a complete CI/CD pipeline with all the infrastructure on AWS (using Terraform). I also wrote 6 articles on medium in which I guide the curious reader to implement all the infrastructure (and pipeline). The technologies that I used were:\n\n - GIT; \n - Node.js/Express.js --> Back-end for the sample web app; \n - Bitbucket --> Remote repository; \n - Jenkins --> CI / CD pipeline triggered on a push of the code in the remote repository; \n - Docker --> Build and serve the web app; \n - AWS --> EC2 instaces (one for Jenkins and one for the Web app), S3 buckets to store logs, ECR to store docker artifacts, Secrets Manager to store Bitbucket SSH keys, Network (VPC, subnets, network interfaces, etc..); everything implemented using Terraform. \n - Slack --> Instant feedback sent by Jenkins regarding the progress of the pipeline; \n - Terraform --> Implement all the AWS infrastructure as code (IaC).\n\n For more details on this project, check my medium articles: https://faun.pub/build-a-complete-ci-cd-pipeline-and-its-infrastructure-with-aws-jenkins-bitbucket-docker-bd29968a99b6.",

Some of them:\n\n - COBOL and Mainframe; \n - Professional Scrum Master; \n - Become a MERN stack javascript developer; \n - Become an Ethical Hacker. \n\nIn these couple of months I had also been assigned to a team dedicated to functional and stress tests, thanks to which I also gained some foundations of Katalon and JMeter. I focused my time mainly on learning the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and creating a tutorial on my github on how to build a web site completely from scratch using these technologies (authentication / authorization - logging in, logging out - input sanification and validation). \nThe ethical hacking course gave me insights on network protocols, vulnerabilities of web applications, operating systems, etc.., how to exploit them and how to secure them.",
