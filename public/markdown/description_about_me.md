I am a very dynamic and curious guy, fascinated by the mysteries of our universe and the technology that we came to develop in these last few decades. My accademic path studying physics has been a wonderful journey, and I'm still amazed by the astonishing inner workings of our reality that we managed to discover mostly in the last couple of centuries.

I love science and I love learning. I feel some kind of drive towards the unknown, I love to test my skills and face new challenges.

```
 Always Improve
```

is my motto!

These are the topics I'm currently most interested in:

- Web Development;
- DevOps;
- Blockchain technologies;
- Ethical Hacking.

Also, I love sharing my knowledge, and for that reason, I'm publishing articles on Medium hoping to transfer some of my knowledge to other people and ease their journey through all these technologies.
