Learning period in which I attended lots of online courses. Some of them:

- COBOL and Mainframe;
- Professional Scrum Master;
- Become a MERN stack javascript developer;
- Become an Ethical Hacker.

In these couple of months I had also been assigned to a team dedicated to functional and stress tests, thanks to which I also gained some foundations of Katalon and JMeter. I focused my time mainly on learning the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and creating a tutorial on my github on how to build a web site completely from scratch using these technologies (authentication / authorization - logging in, logging out - input sanification and validation).

The ethical hacking course gave me insights on network protocols, vulnerabilities of web applications, operating systems, etc.., how to exploit them and how to secure them.
