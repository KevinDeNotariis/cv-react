Successfully created a robust AWS Landing Zone from scratch for the client, leveraging Control Tower and AFT (Account Factory for Terraform). Established the organization structure and implemented the Account Vending Machine, streamlining the process of provisioning new AWS accounts.

Set up Organizational Units (OUs) and configured Service Control Policies (SCPs) to enforce governance and compliance requirements across the client's AWS environment.

Implemented various security and audit services, including Security Hub, CloudTrail, and AWS Config, to ensure comprehensive monitoring and compliance with industry best practices.

Developed and refined multiple Terraform modules to provision different AWS environments (test, development, acceptance, and production). These modules encompassed a wide range of AWS resources, totaling nearly 300 instances, databases, networking components, and other infrastructure elements.

Consolidated the individual modules into a unified module, enabling streamlined deployments of any environment with a single command, resulting in significant time and effort savings.

Utilized Terraform as the primary infrastructure as code tool, ensuring consistent and reproducible deployments across all AWS environments.

Collaborated closely with cross-functional teams, including developers, system administrators, and project managers, to gather requirements, design solutions, and deliver high-quality infrastructure deployments.

Provided guidance and support to the client's internal teams, facilitating knowledge transfer and empowering them to manage and maintain the AWS environment independently.
